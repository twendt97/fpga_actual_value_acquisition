# Actual Value acquisition with a FPGA

This project is part of the [UltraZohm](https://ultrazohm.com/) project. Please refer to [the official documentation](https://docs.ultrazohm.com/mpsoc/ip_cores/adc_ltc2311_v3/adc_ltc2311_v3.html) for a complete description of this IP-Core.

# Structure:

``ADC_LTC2311_3.0``: Implementation of the IP-Core. Refer to the directory ``ADC_LTC2311_3.0/hdl`` for the VHDL code.

``software``: Softare driver in C and the corresponding tests for test driven development.
